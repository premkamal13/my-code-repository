  <p>Alice and Bob are playing a game of moving coin on a N x N grid of 0s and 1s. Rows are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom and Columns are<br> numbered 1 to N from left to right. Starting from a cell in the 1st row, they take turns alternately each time moving the coin to the next<br> row. From a cell (i,j) they can move the coin to any of the cells (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) as long as it lies inside the grid.<br> The game halts when the coin reaches the last row. Alice wants to collect as many 1s as possible along the path, while Bob wants to collect<br> as many 0s as possible.</p> 
  <p>The game starts with Alice placing the coin in a cell in the 1st row, then Bob moving it from the 1st row to the 2nd row and then Alice<br> moving it to the 3rd row and so on. In how many cells in the 1st row can Alice place the coin initially, such that the number of 1s<br> encountered along the path from top to bottom is at least K, if both play optimally. Note that such a path covers exactly N cells, including<br> a cell in the 1st Row.</p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> 
  <p>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each test case consists of N K in the first line followed by the<br> description of the grid in the next N lines. Each row of the grid is given as a string of 0s and 1s, without spaces in between. A blank<br> line precedes each test case.</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> 
  <p>Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer.</p>
