<p>Krishna loves Radha and wants to propose her in a different way. He wants to tell her the message, but he wanted the message to be a surprise. So, he plans to encrypt the message and send the encrypted message to Radha and he also gives the key to decrypt. He thinks that this might be a surprise to Radha. Help Radha to decrypt the message.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rules of encryption</strong></span> :</p> 
<p>0&lt;=key&lt;=51</p> 
<p>The original message only consists of a-z, A-Z, and space.</p> 
<p>Spaces are encrypted as '.'</p> 
<p>If key lies between 0 and 25, then the character is added with the key and modulo is taken and the case is maintained. For eg, if key is 3, then a is decrypted to d and e is decrypted to h.</p> 
<p>If key lies between 26 and 51, then the character is added with the key and modulo is taken and the case is inverted. For eg, if key is 29, then a is decrypted to D and E is decrypted to h.</p>
