<p>Sachin loves to hit boundaries. His lucky digits are 4 and 6. A lucky number is one which has its last digit lucky. 144, 124, 156 are lucky numbers while 111, 123, 667, 249 are not lucky. Given a number he wants to find the minimum of summands which are lucky numbers, necessary to produce a sum equal to the given number.<br>If not possible, print -1.<br><br>INPUT:<br>Each file will consist of a number of test cases T. Each test case will consist of only one number N in one line.<br><br>OUTPUT:<br>Print the least number of lucky summands as given in the question. If not possible, print -1.<br><br>Constraints:<br>T &lt;= 100000 (10^5)<br>N &lt;= 10^18<br><br>Time limit:<br>1 sec for each file.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>Input:<br>1<br>10<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>2<br><br>Explaination:<br>For the first case:<br>10 = 6 + 4. So, we need only two lucky numbers.</p>
