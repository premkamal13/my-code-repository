# my_code_repository

This repository has some of my solutions to competitive programming problems done on SPOJ, codeforces and codechef.


**Who should be using this?**
- People stuck on a certain problem looking for an approach to the problem
- People trying to explore another way of solving the problem they have already solved
- Me to take a look back at what ways I had thought about solving the problem before

_Please don't use it without spending a few hours on the problem by yourself! It will bias your approach and will do more harm than good_ 
* Apologies for unclean design in the solutions as these are snippets from my college days and lacked focus on design at that time. 

**Happy Coding !**


## How to extract your solutions from the platfoms?

### You can directly clone and use  https://github.com/premkamal13/code-backup (for codechef and codeforces) and https://github.com/premkamal13/spoj-back-up (for spoj) for the extraction. The Code-back repo misses out on many SPOJ solutions (haven't debugged it yet) 

**Credits** 
I have forked these repositories from the following and made some minor fixes to make them work for SPOJ :
- https://github.com/koldbyte/CodeBackup
- https://github.com/ideamonk/spojbackup
