# my_code_repository

This repository has some of my solutions to competitive programming problems done on SPOJ, codeforces and codechef.

Who should be using this?
- People stuck on a certain problem looking for an approach to the problem
- People trying to explore another way of solving the problem they have already solved
- Me to take a look back at what ways I had thought about solving the problem before

Please don't use it without spending a few hours on the problem by yourself! It will bias your approach and will do more harm than good 
* Apologies for unclean design in the solutions as these are snippets from my college days and lacked focus on design at that time. 

Happy Coding !
